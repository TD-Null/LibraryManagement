# Library Management System Project
This project consists of a software implementation of a library management system, built to simulate the main functions of a library. This systems helps keep in track of book checkouts, reservations, renewals, and returns, as well as members' profiles and subscriptions to the system. Librarians will be responsible for adding, removing, and modifying libraries and books to the system as well as managing the records of book loans and reservations.

## System Requirements
The Library Management System will keep these rules in mind when considering its software implementation:
1. Any member with a membership subscription to the system and a library card will be able to search for books based on library, title, author, subject, and publication date. (These categories are optional and not all parameters need to be filled out to search for books.)
3. Each book will have a unique identification number and other details including a rack number which will help to physically locate the book.
4. There could be more than one copy of a book, and library members should be able to check-out and reserve any copy. We will call each copy of a book, a book item.
5. The system should be able to retrieve information like who took a particular book or what are the books checked-out by a specific library member.
6. There should be a maximum limit (5) on how many books a member can check-out.
7. There should be a maximum limit (10) on how many days a member can keep a book.
8. The system should be able to collect fines for books returned after the due date.
9. Members should be able to reserve books that are not currently available.
10. The system should be able to send notifications whenever the reserved books become available, as well as when the book is not returned within the due date.
11. Each book and member card will have a unique barcode. The system will be able to read barcodes from books and membersâ€™ library cards.
